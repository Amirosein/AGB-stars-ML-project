# AGB-stars-ML-project

* In this project, we are going to solve a classification problem with 5 classes of (O-C-S rich) AGBs, Post AGBs and Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) by their spectroscopy data.
The raw data which is different classes' data files are provided in the "main" individually. 

* In the [first Milestone](https://github.com/Churchiill/AGB-stars-ML-project/tree/main/Milestone1) we have cleaned up and normalized the features by **Standard**, **Robust** and **MinMax** scalers. You can find all of these features in [1<sup>st</sup> Milestone Data](https://github.com/Churchiill/AGB-stars-ML-project/tree/main/Milestone1/data).
