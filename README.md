# AGB and YSO stars Classification

In this project, we are going to solve a classification problem with 5 classes of **(O-C-S rich) AGBs, Post AGBs and Young Stellar Objects (YSOs)** by their spectroscopy data.
The raw data which is different classes' data files are provided in the [main](https://github.com/Churchiill/AGB-stars-ML-project/tree/main) separately. 

<h1>First Milestone</h1> 

* In the [first Milestone](https://github.com/Churchiill/AGB-stars-ML-project/tree/main/Milestone1) we have cleaned up the data and normalized the features by **Standard**, **Robust** and **MinMax** scalers. We have also encoded the output classes by **One-Hot Encoding** method and you can find all of the aforementioned data files in [1<sup>st</sup> Milestone Data](https://github.com/Churchiill/AGB-stars-ML-project/tree/main/Milestone1/data).

* Moreover, the first Milestone's **report** and its **(ipynb) code file** are provided in [first Milestone](https://github.com/Churchiill/AGB-stars-ML-project/tree/main/Milestone1). 

* One Can also download first milestone files all together by [Milestone_1.zip](https://github.com/Churchiill/AGB-stars-ML-project/blob/main/Milestone1_data.rar).



<h1>Second Milestone</h1>
